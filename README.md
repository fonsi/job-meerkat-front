## Tech Stack

It is a **NextJS** project deployed in **AWS S3** and using:

- **Typescript** as main language
- **React** to create the UI components
- **Styled Components** for styles
- **Jest** and **Testing Library** for unit testing

## Environment

You can build the project for _development_ or _production_ using the build scripts in package.json (`npm run build:dev` and `npm run build:prod`).

For that scripts to work you need to create the _.env.dev_ and/or _.env.prod_ files following the structure defined in _.env.dist_.
